    "paper_abstract": "Narrow bandgap InAs$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ nanowires show broad prospects for applications in wide spectrum infrared detectors, high-performance transistors and quantum computation. Realizing such applications require the fine control of composition and crystal structure of nanowires. However, to date, the fabrication of large-composition-range pure-phase homogeneous InAs$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ nanowires remains a huge challenge. Here, we first report the growth of large-composition-range stemless InAs$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ nanowires (x = 0-0.63) on Si (111) substrates by molecular-beam epitaxy. It is found that pure-phase InAs$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ nanowires can be successfully obtained by controlling the antimony content x, nanowire diameter and nanowire growth direction. Detailed EDS data show that the antimony is uniformly distributed along the axial and radial directions of InAs$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ nanowires and no spontaneous core-shell nanostructures form in the nanowires. Based on field-effect measurements, we confirm that InAs$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ nanowires exhibit good conductivity and their mobilities can be up to 4200 cm^2/V.s at 7 K. Our work lays the foundation for the development of InAs$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ nanowire optoelectronic, electronic and quantum devices.",

For stemless TAP, we prove that the integrality ratio of an SDP relaxation (the Lasserre tightening of an LP relaxation) is $\\leq \\frac{3}{2}+\u03b5$, where $\u03b5>0$ can be any small constant. We obtain this result by designing a polynomial-time algorithm for stemless TAP that achieves an approximation guarantee of ($\\frac32+\u03b5$) relative to the SDP relaxation. The algorithm is combinatorial and does not solve the SDP relaxation, but our analysis relies on the SDP relaxation.\n  We generalize the combinatorial analysis of integral solutions from the previous literature to fractional solutions by identifying some properties of fractional solutions of the Lasserre system via the decomposition result of Karlin, Mathieu and Nguyen (IPCO 2011).\n  Also, we present an example of stemless TAP such that the approximation guarantee of $\\frac32$ is tight for the algorithm.\n  In Part II of this paper, we extend the methods of Part I to prove the same results relative to the same SDP relaxation for TAP.",

The Q2D drops are created by confining liquids between vertical walls, leading to formation of low aspect ratio capillary bridges that are deformed by gravity. When stationary, the Q2D drops adopt projected shapes that are analogous to 3D sessile drops, ranging from circular drops to puddles. When moving, the Q2D drops exhibit capillary and fluid mechanical behaviours analogous to 3D drops, including impacts and sliding on pseudo-surfaces. The Q2D drops also exhibit considerably more complex phenomena such as levitation, instabilities and pattern formation when subjected to external electric, magnetic and flow fields -- all seen also in regular 3D drops. The presented 3D-Q2D analogy suggests that the diverse and often complicated phenomena observed in 3D drops can be studied in the Q2D geometry, allowing also new physics arising from the reduced dimensionality and the new boundary conditions.",

Optical characterization via the scattering of light does not require complicated sample preparation and can in principle be carried out in-situ. We describe the characterization of single nanoparticle shape based on the measurement of their rotational and oscillatory motion when optically levitated within vacuum. Using colloidally grown yttrium lithium fluoride nanocrystals of different sizes, trapped in a single-beam optical tweezer, we demonstrate the utility of this method which is in good agreement with simulations of the dynamics. Size differences as small as a few nanometers could be resolved using this technique offering a new optical spectroscopic tool for non-contact characterization of single nanoparticles in the absence of a substrate.",

However, existing platforms based on spatial light modulators for studying interactions between levitated particles suffered from low efficiency, instability at focal points, the complexity of optical systems, and the scalability for sensing applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrated that a metasurface which forms two diffraction-limited focal points with a high numerical aperture (0.9) and high efficiency (31%) can generate tunable optical potential wells without any intensity fluctuations. A bistable potential and double potential wells were observed in the experiment by varying the focal points distance, and two nanoparticles were levitated in double potential wells for hours, which could be used for investigating the levitated particles nonlinear dynamics, thermal dynamics, and optical binding. This would pave the way for scaling the number of levitated optomechanical devices or realizing paralleled levitated sensors.",

We study the simultaneous cooling of these mechanical modes in both the three-mode and five-mode cavity-levitated optomechanical models. It is found that there exists the dark-mode effect when the two tweezers have the same powers, which suppress the simultaneous ground-state cooling. Nevertheless, the simultaneous ground-state cooling of these modes can be realized by breaking the dark-mode effect under proper parameters. Our system provides a versatile platform to study quantum effects and applications in cavity-levitated optomechanical systems.",

Optomechanical interaction can also be mediated by photothermal effects which, although frequently overlooked, may compete with radiation pressure interaction. Understanding of how these phenomena affect the coherent exchange of information between optical and mechanical degrees of freedom is often underdeveloped, particularly in mesoscale high-power systems where photothermal effects can fully dominate the interaction. Here we report an effective theoretical model to predict and successfully reconstruct the dynamics of a unique optomechanical system: a cavity-enhanced setup for macroscopic optical levitation, where a free-standing mirror acts as the optomechanical oscillator. We decompose the photothermal interaction into two opposing light-induced effects, photothermal expansion, and thermo-optic effects. We then reconstruct a heuristic model that links the intracavity field to four types of cavity length changes caused by acoustic ($x_\\textrm{ac}$), centre of mass ($x_\\textrm{lev}$), photothermal ($x_\\textrm{ex}$) and thermo-optic ($x_\\textrm{re}$) displacements. This offers refined predictions with a higher degree of agreement with experimental results.

Anharmonic dynamics is an essential ingredient to generate these states, but for large mechanical systems, the effect of the anharmonicity tends to become negligible compared to decoherence. As a possible solution to this challenge, we propose to use a motional squeezed state as a resource to effectively enhance the anharmonicity. We analyze the production of negativity in the Wigner distribution of a quantum anharmonic resonator initially in a squeezed state. We find that initial squeezing enhances the rate at which negativity is generated. We also analyze the effect of two common sources of decoherence, namely energy damping and dephasing, and find that the detrimental effects of energy damping are suppressed by strong squeezing. In the limit of large squeezing, which is needed for state-of-the-art systems, we find good approximations for the Wigner function. Our analysis is significant for current experiments attempting to prepare macroscopic mechanical systems in genuine quantum states. We provide an overview of several experimental platforms featuring nonlinear behaviors and low levels of decoherence.

Acoustic levitation has gained significant attention in various fields due to its potential to create a lab-in-a-drop. Although evaporation is a key process in nature and industry, many studies have focused on single and binary components, and ternary droplets in acoustic levitation have rarely been experimentally investigated. In this study, the evaporation-induced spontaneous emulsification (the Ouzo effect) and phase separation process at 40-90 vol% ethanol were visualized. We estimated the concentration change by evaporation of each component in the levitated ternary droplets based on the evaporation model to identify the experimental results. Our experimental results revealed four distinct stages of evaporation in levitated Ouzo droplets: (1) preferential evaporation of the volatile component (ethanol), (2) spontaneous emulsification (myriad micro-oil droplets generation), (3) phase separation forming a core-shell droplet, and (4) water evaporation completion resulting in remaining an oil droplet. Finally, we analyzed the emulsification process by a spacetime diagram. These findings suggest that acoustic levitation is suitable for physicochemical manipulation in mid-air.",

    "paper_abstract": "If the terrestrial environment is permeated by dark matter, the levitation experiences damping forces and fluctuations attributed to dark matter. This paper investigates levitodynamics with multiple stochastic forces, including thermal drag, photon recoil, feedback, etc., assuming that all of these forces adhere to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The ratio of total damping to the stochastic damping coefficient distinguishes the levitodynamics from cases involving only one single stochastic force. The heating and cooling processes are formulated to determine the limits of temperature change. All sources of stochastic forces are comprehensively examined, revealing that dark matter collisions cannot be treated analogously to fluid dynamics. Additionally, a meticulous analysis is presented, elucidating the intricate relationship between the fundamental transfer cross-section and the macroscopic transfer cross-section. While the dark damping coefficient is suppressed by the mass of the levitated particle, scattering can be coherently enhanced based on the scale of the component microscopic particle, the atomic form factor, and the static structure factor. Hence, dark damping holds the potential to provide valuable insights into the detection of the macroscopic strength of fundamental particles. We propose experimental procedures for levitation and employ linear estimation to extract the dark damping coefficient. Utilizing current levitation results, we demonstrate that the fundamental transfer cross section of dark matter can be of the order $\u03c3^{\\rm D}_{T}\\lsim {\\cal O}(10^{-26})\\rm cm^2$.",

In this work, we demonstrate the passive, diamagnetic levitation of a centimeter-sized massive oscillator which is fabricated using a novel method that ensures that the material, though highly diamagnetic, is an electrical insulator. By chemically coating a powder of microscopic graphite beads with silica and embedding the coated powder in high-vacuum compatible wax, we form a centimeter-sized thin square plate which magnetically levitates over a checkerboard magnet array. The insulating coating reduces eddy damping by almost an order of magnitude compared to uncoated graphite with the same particle size. These plates exhibit a different equilibrium orientation to pyrolytic graphite due to their isotropic magnetic susceptibility. We measure the motional quality factor to be Q~1.58*10^5 for an approximately centimeter-sized composite resonator with a mean particle size of 12 microns. Further, we apply delayed feedback to cool the vertical motion of frequency ~19 Hz from room temperature to 320 millikelvin.",

The advent of machine learning has opened up new avenues for tackling these diseases effectively. Early detection and diagnosis are essential for successful crop management. While no automated systems have yet been developed specifically for jamun leaf disease detection, various automated systems have been implemented for similar types of disease detection using image processing techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive review of machine learning methodologies employed for diagnosing plant leaf diseases through image classification, which can be adapted for jamun leaf disease detection. It meticulously assesses the strengths and limitations of various Vision Transformer models, including Transfer learning model and vision transformer (TLMViT), SLViT, SE-ViT, IterationViT, Tiny-LeViT, IEM-ViT, GreenViT, and PMViT. Additionally, the paper reviews models such as Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), Residual Neural Network (ResNet)-50V2, EfficientNet, Ensemble model, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Locally Reversible Transformer. These machine-learning models have been evaluated on various datasets, demonstrating their real-world applicability. This review not only sheds light on current advancements in the field but also provides valuable insights for future research directions in machine learning-based jamun leaf disease detection and classification.",

While most current levitation platforms are complex and bulky, miniaturization is sought to gain robustness and facilitate their integration into confined settings, such as cryostats or portable devices. Integration on chip is also anticipated to enhance the control over the particle motion through a more precise engineering of optical and electric fields. As a substantial milestone towards this goal, we present here levitation and motion control in high vacuum of a silica nanoparticle at the surface of a hybrid optical-electrostatic chip. By combining fiber-based optical trapping and sensitive position detection with cold damping through planar electrodes, we cool the particle motion to a few hundred phonons. Our results pave the way to the next generation of integrated levitation platforms combining integrated photonics and nanophotonics with engineered electric potentials, towards complex state preparation and read out.",

The inclusion of this dark charge modifies the gravitational properties of the spacetime, while not affecting ordinary electrodynamics. Geodesic motions of both charged and uncharged SM test particles are modified due to the presence of dark charge. The modifications may allow the detection and measurement of the dark charge. In particular, (1) the effective potential for orbiting particles is modified, and consequently, (2) the angular momenta and ISCOs of test masses in circular orbits are changed from those for the usual Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m case. (3) In the case of a naked singularity, it is possible that a \"levitating atmosphere\", due to short distance repulsive gravity, forms at the zero gravity radius, which depends upon both SM and DM charges.

By subjecting stainless steel 316 (SS), epoxy resin-coated (ER), and laser-textured (LT) surfaces with known surface roughness, hardness, and structural characteristics to 40 ice droplet impacts each, the effect on surface properties and their effect on solid-solid interfacial impact dynamics, in turn, was examined using a novel analysis framework based on fundamental conservation laws. For the velocities experienced in this study, the impacts did not affect the surface properties; they were consistent after each impact. Elasticity was the most significant factor in droplet behavior: the ER surface exhibited rebounding for 78% of impacts (important for moving surfaces). Surface roughness also played a role, particularly for droplets with rotational motion, as immobilization occurred for 66% of impacts on the rougher LT surface. However, the nanostructures on that textured surface resulted in droplet redirection perpendicular to the surface directionality (critical for stationary surfaces). In contrast, the other surfaces saw no change or no consistent change in rebound angle. Elasticity also affected momentum retention, where the ER surface had a translational restitution coefficient of 0.32 compared to 0.17 for the two stainless steel surfaces. Surface roughness was the predominant aspect of energy retention: the LT surface had a translational-to-rotational energy transfer coefficient of 0.07 (0.23 for the smoother surfaces), resulting in an overall energy retention coefficient of 0.09 compared to 0.28 for the SS and ER surfaces on average.",

    "paper_abstract": "Some He-rich hot subdwarf stars (He-sdOBs) present high abundances of trans-iron elements, such as Sr, Y, Zr and Pb. Diffusion processes are important in hot subdwarf stars, and it is thought that the high abundances of heavy elements in these stars are due to the action of radiative levitation. However, during the formation of He-sdOBs, hydrogen can be ingested into the convective zone driven by the He-core flash. It is known that episodes in which protons are being ingested into He-burning convective zones can lead to neutron-capture processes and the formation of heavy elements. In this work we aim to explore for the first time if neutron-capture processes can occur in late He-core flashes happening in the cores of the progenitors of He-sdOBs. We compute a detailed evolutionary model of a stripped red-giant star with a stellar evolution code with a nuclear network comprising 32 isotopes. Then we post-process the stellar models in the phase of He and H burning with a post-processing nucleosynthesis code with a nuclear network of 1190 species that allows us to follow the neutron-capture processes in detail. We find the occurrence of neutron-capture processes in our model, with neutron densities reaching a value of $\\sim5\\times10^{12}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-3}$. We find that the trans-iron elements are enhanced in the surface by 1 to 2 dex as compared to initial compositions. Moreover, the relative abundance pattern $[{\\rm X}_i/\\rm{Fe}]$ produced by neutron-capture processes closely resembles those observed in some He-sdOBs, hinting at a possible self-synthesized origin of the heavy elements in these stars. We conclude that intermediate neutron-capture processes can occur during a proton ingestion event in the He-core flash of stripped red-giant stars. This mechanism offers a natural channel to produce the heavy elements observed in some of the He-sdOBs.",

    "paper_abstract": "We report the study of a self-excited converging shock structure observed in a complex plasma medium for the first time. A high-density dust cloud of melamine formaldehyde particles is created and horizontally confined by a circular ring in a DC glow discharge plasma at a particular discharge voltage and pressure. Later on, as the discharge voltage is increased, a circular density crest is spontaneously generated around the outer boundary of the dust cloud. This nonlinear density structure is seen to propagate inward towards the center of the dust cloud. The properties of the excited structure are analyzed and found to follow the characteristics of a converging shock structure. A three dimension molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has also been performed in which a stable dust cloud is formed and levitated by the balance of forces due to gravity and an external electric field mimicking the cathode sheath electric field in the experiment. Particles are also horizontally confined by an external electric field, representing the sheath electric field of the circular ring present in the experiment. A circular shock structure has been excited by applying an external perturbation in the horizontal electric field around the outer boundary of the dust cloud. The characteristic properties of the shock are analyzed in the simulation and qualitatively compared with the experimental findings. This study is not only of fundamental interest but has many implications concerning the study of converging shock waves excited in other media for various potential applications.",

    "paper_abstract": "Ultraprecise mechanical sensors offer an exciting avenue for testing new physics. While many of these sensors are tailored to detect inertial forces, magnetically levitated (Maglev) systems are particularly interesting, in that they are also sensitive to electromagnetic forces. In this work, we propose the use of magnetically levitated superconductors to detect dark-photon and axion dark matter through their couplings to electromagnetism. Several existing laboratory experiments search for these dark-matter candidates at high frequencies, but few are sensitive to frequencies below $\\mathrm{1\\,kHz}$ (corresponding to dark-matter masses $m_\\mathrm{DM}\\lesssim10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$). As a mechanical resonator, magnetically levitated superconductors are sensitive to lower frequencies, and so can probe parameter space currently unexplored by laboratory experiments. Dark-photon and axion dark matter can source an oscillating magnetic field that drives the motion of a magnetically levitated superconductor. This motion is resonantly enhanced when the dark matter Compton frequency matches the levitated superconductor's trapping frequency. We outline the necessary modifications to make magnetically levitated superconductors sensitive to dark matter, including specifications for both broadband and resonant schemes. We show that in the $\\mathrm{Hz}\\lesssim f_\\mathrm{DM}\\lesssim\\mathrm{kHz}$ frequency range our technique can achieve the leading sensitivity amongst laboratory probes of both dark-photon and axion dark matter.",

In the context of nanomechanics, the analogy in the dissipation free case has already been tested in multiple experimental setups, e.g., doubly clamped or cantilever string resonators and optically levitated particles. A well-known result of this classical analogy is that the relaxation and decoherence times of the analog quantum system must be equal, i.e. $T_1=T_2$, in contrast to the general case of quantum TLS. We show that this fundamentally quantum feature, i.e. $T_1\\neq T_2$, can be implemented as well in the aforementioned classical systems by adding stochastic fluctuations in their internal parameters. Moreover, we show that these stochastic contributions can be engineered in the control apparatus of those systems.",

One of important features that needs to be explained is an apparent contradiction between an extremely high critical temperature Tc and rather modest critical magnetic field Bc and critical current jc reported for LK-99. We show theoretically, that these data may be quantitatively reproduced assuming the interplay between exciton- and phonon-induced superconductivity, while the conventional BCS or Brinkman-Rice-Bardeen-Cooper-Schriefer (BR-BCS) mechanisms would result in a much higher Bc for the same Tc.",

Such interesting HL appearance has drawn tremendous sensation both in academia and the network. However, the true identity of LK-99 still remains unclear, i.e., whether the HL behavior can necessarily indicate the diamagnetism behavior of the sample. Here, we fabricated our own LK-99 samples following the procedures reported by Lee et al. We found quite a few sample pieces showing the typical HL that is similar to those reported. Meanwhile, oxidation during the sample preparation was found to deleterious to acquiring HL in the sample, while furnace cooling or water quenching in the last step revealed little effect. However, our careful observations indicated that those HL pieces are more likely simple ferromagnetic. Then we conducted a comprehensive study on the behavior patterns of typical diamagnetism and ferromagnetic substances interacting with a Nd2Fe14B magnet, and provided instructions to distinguish the characteristics between ferromagnetic and diamagnetic to prevent misunderstanding of LK-99 like levitation behavior.",

Here, we extend the rotational control toolbox by engineering an optically levitated nanodumbbell in vacuum into controlled spinning around its long axis with spinning rates exceeding 1 GHz. This fast spinning introduces deep-strong coupling between the nanodumbell's libration modes, such that the coupling rate $g$ exceeds the bare libration frequencies $\u03a9_0$ by two orders of magnitude with $g/\u03a9_0=724\\pm 33$. Our control over the long-axis rotation opens the door to study the physics of deep-strong coupled mechanical oscillators and to observe macroscopic rotational quantum interference effects, thus laying a solid foundation for future applications in quantum technologies.

After the bubble nucleation, a quasi steady bubble growth occurs depending on the laser irradiation intensity and concentrations. Our scaling analysis reveals that bubble growth follows Plesset-Zwick criteria independent of the viscoelastic properties of the polymer solution. Further, we establish that the onset of bubble growth has an inverse nonlinear dependence on the laser irradiation intensity. At high concentrations and laser irradiation intensities, we report the expansion and collapse of polymer membrane without rupture, indicating the formation of an interfacial skin with significant strength. The droplet oscillations are primarily driven by the presence of multiple bubbles and, to some extent, by the rotational motion of the droplet. Finally, depending on the nature of bubble growth, different types of precipitate form contrary to the different modes of atomization observed in low viscoelastic modulus polymer droplets.",

At room temperature, this has only been reached in pioneering experiments where an optical restoring force controls the oscillator stiffness, akin to the vibrational motion of atoms in an optical lattice. These include both levitated nanoparticles and optically-trapped cantilevers. Recent advances in engineered mechanical resonators, where the restoring force is provided by material rigidity rather than an external optical potential, have realized ultra-high quality factors (Q) by exploiting `soft clamping'. However entering the quantum regime with such resonators, has so far been prevented by optical cavity frequency fluctuations and thermal intermodulation noise. Here, we overcome this challenge and demonstrate optomechanical squeezing at room temperature in a phononic-engineered membrane-in-the-middle system. By using a high finesse cavity whose mirrors are patterned with phononic crystal structures, we reduce cavity frequency noise by more than 700-fold. In this ultra-low noise cavity, we introduce a silicon nitride membrane oscillator whose density is modulated by silicon nano-pillars, yielding both high thermal conductance and a localized mechanical mode with Q of 1.8e8. These advances enable operation within a factor of 2.5 of the Heisenberg limit, leading to squeezing of the probing field by 1.09 dB below the vacuum fluctuations. Moreover, the long thermal decoherence time of the membrane oscillator (more than 30 vibrational periods) allows us to obtain conditional displaced thermal states of motion with an occupation of 0.97 phonon, using a multimode Kalman filter. Our work extends quantum control of engineered macroscopic oscillators to room temperature.",

    "paper_abstract": "Micro/Nano-positioning stages are of great importance in a wide range of manufacturing machines and instruments. In recent years, the drastically growing demand for higher throughput and reduced power consumption in various IC manufacturing equipment calls for the development of next-generation precision positioning systems with unprecedented acceleration capability while maintaining exceptional positioning accuracy and high control bandwidth. Reducing the stage's weight is an effective approach to achieving this goal. However, the reduction of stages' weight tends to decrease its structural resonance frequency, which limits the closed-loop control bandwidth and can even cause stability issues. Aiming to overcome the aforementioned challenge and thus create new lightweight precision stages with substantially improved acceleration capability without sacrificing stage control performance, this research presents a novel sequential structure and control design framework for lightweight stages with low-frequency flexible modes of the stage being actively controlled. Additional actuators and sensors are placed to actively control the flexible structural dynamics of the lightweight stage to attain high control bandwidth. A case study is simulated to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, where a stage weight reduction of 24% is demonstrated compared to a baseline case, which demonstrates the potential of the proposed design framework. Experimental evaluation of the designed stage's motion performance will be performed on a magnetically levitated linear motor platform for performance demonstration.",

The experiment is performed in a strongly coupled dusty plasma consisting of monodisperse micron particles levitated in the sheath of a capacitively coupled RF argon plasma. The non-planar waves are generated with the help of a cylindrical conducting exciter pin placed at the centre of the homogeneous dust cloud. A negative excitation pulse is used to create a dust void and a dust density perturbation simultaneously around the exciter. From the edge of the void, the density perturbation propagates as a nonlinear (cylindrical) non-planar dust acoustic solitary wave. The characteristics of the solitary wave are measured using image analysis of the recorded video of wave propagation. Numerical solution of the modified Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation with an additional term to take care of the non-planar geometry is compared with the experimental observation. The wave amplitude and width are measured as a function of time and compared with the theoretical predictions.",

    "paper_abstract": "Precision motion stages play a critical role in various manufacturing and inspection equipment, for example, the wafer/reticle scanning in photolithography scanners and positioning stages in wafer inspection systems. To meet the growing demand for higher throughput in chip manufacturing and inspection, it is critical to create new precision motion stages with higher acceleration capability with high control bandwidth, which calls for the development of lightweight precision stages. However, in today's precision motion systems, only the rigid body motion of the system are under control, and the flexible dynamic systems are in open loop. For these systems, the motion control bandwidth is limited by the first structural resonance frequency of the stage, which enforces a fundamental trade-off between the stage's bandwidth and acceleration capability. Aiming to overcome this trade-off, we have introduced a sequential structure and control design framework for lightweight stages with the low-frequency flexible modes of the stage are under active control. To facilitate the controller design, we further propose to minimize the resonance frequency of the stage's mode being controlled and to maximize the resonance frequency of the uncontrolled mode. The system's control bandwidth is placed in between the resonance frequencies. This paper presents the design, optimization, building, and experimental evaluations for a lightweight magnetically levitated planar stage, which we call FleXstage, with first flexible mode actively controlled via over-actuation. Simulations show the proposed design is highly promising in enabling stages with lightweight without sacrificing control bandwidth. We have some preliminary results now and are still working on the experimental evaluations for the closed-loop system, and will present the results in the oral presentation.",

A PMMA microfluidic chip was used to transfer fluid containing two different solutions and achieve fast and efficient mixing. By adjusting five different flow rates and altering the rotational speeds of the microrobots, the mixing efficiency was observed. The studies were carried out under the laminar regime, with incompressible Newtonian flow rates and varying actuator speeds. The measurement of mixing efficiency was accomplished through the calculation of changes in pixel intensity observed in microscopic images acquired throughout the mixing process. The presence of the microrobots resulted in the best efficiency at 80.37% at 500 rpm and 7 mL/min flow rate.

In this study we perform the global calculation of nuclear properties for even-even $8 \\leq Z \\leq 104$ nuclei at temperatures in range $0\\le T \\le 2$ MeV. Calculations are based on the finite temperature relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model supplemented by the Bonche-Levit-Vautherin vapor subtraction procedure.

Results include neutron emission lifetimes, quadrupole deformations, neutron skin thickness, proton and neutron pairing gaps, entropy and excitation energy. Up to the temperature $T\\approx 1$ MeV nuclear landscape is influenced only moderately by the finite-temperature effects, mainly by reducing the pairing correlations. As the temperature increases further, the effects on nuclear structures become pronounced, reducing both the deformations and the shell effects.",

We here experimentally investigate the large deviation properties of the stochastic work and heat of a levitated nanoparticle subjected to nonequilibrium feedback control. This setting allows us to determine for each quantity the convergence domain of the large deviation estimators using a criterion that does not require the knowledge of the probability distribution. By extracting both the asymptotic exponential decay and the subexponential prefactors, we demonstrate that singular prefactors significantly restrict the convergence characteristics. Our results provide unique insight into the approach to the asymptotic large deviation limit and underscore the pivotal role of singular prefactors.",

To address these gaps, we fabricate an integrated surface ion trap with multiple stabilization electrodes. This facilitates on-chip levitation and, for the first time, optically detected magnetic resonance measurements of a nanodiamond levitated in high vacuum. The internal temperature of our levitated nanodiamond remains moderate below $10^{-5}$ Torr. Impressively, we have driven a nanodiamond to rotate up to 20 MHz ($1.2 \\times 10^{9}$ rpm), surpassing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electron spin dephasing rates. Using these NV spins, we observe the pseudo-magnetic field arising from particle rotation. In addition, we demonstrate quantum coherent control of spins in a rotating nanodiamond.

By employing numerically exact methods, we fully characterize the phase diagram of the model in terms of spectral, localization and topological properties. Unlike in the presence of regular disorder, the quadratic band crossing is stable towards the application of the quasiperiodic potential and most of the topological phase transitions occur through a gap closing and reopening mechanism, as in the homogeneous case. With a sufficiently strong quasiperiodic potential, the quadratic band crossing point splits into Dirac cones which enables transitions into gapped phases with Chern numbers $C=\\pm1$, absent in the homogeneous limit. This is in sharp contrast with the disordered case, where gapless $C=\\pm1$ phases can arise by perturbing the band crossing with any amount of disorder. In the quasiperiodic case, we find that the $C=\\pm1$ phases can only become gapless for a very strong potential. Only in this regime, the subsequent quasiperiodic-induced topological transitions into the trivial phase mirror the well-known ``levitation and annihilation'' mechanism in the disordered case.",

The investigation not only uncovers an unexpected branch flow phenomenon within the film, challenging existing assumptions, but also reveals a fascinating interplay between vortex flow and branch flow. The experiments have revealed a captivating spectrum of dynamic phenomena within the thin liquid films. The observation of small-scale capillary waves, large-scale standing waves, traveling waves, and the intricate fusion of capillary-gravity wave patterns underscores the rich complexity inherent in the interaction between the films and the holographic ultrasonic wave field. These diverse states of film dynamics provide a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between various wave modes and fluid behavior, further enhancing comprehension of this fascinating phenomenon.

However, current techniques for fast and reliable rotation of particles with internal spins face challenges, such as optical absorption and heating issues. Here, to address this gap, we demonstrate electrically driven rotation of micro-particles levitating in Paul traps. We show that micro-particles can be set to rotate stably at 150,000 rpm by operating in a hitherto unexplored parametrically driven regime using the particle electric quadrupolar moment. Moreover, the spin states of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds undergoing full rotation were successfully controlled, allowing accurate angular trajectory reconstruction and demonstrating high rotational stability over extended periods. These achievements mark progress toward interfacing full rotation with internal magnetic degrees of freedom in micron-scale objects. In particular, it extends significantly the type of particles that can be rotated, such as ferromagnets, which offers direct implications for the study of large gyromagnetic effects at the micro-scale.",

It is worthwhile to study how the long-term rate of decoherence depends on the spectral density characterizing the system-bath interaction in this exactly solvable model. Secondly, we address a more general problem of the Markovian embedding of a non-Markovian open system dynamics. It is often assumed that a non-Markovian open quantum system can be embedded into a larger Markovian system. However, we show that such embedding is possible only for the Ohmic spectral densities (for the case of a positive bath temperature) and is impossible for both the sub- and super-Ohmic spectral densities.

    "paper_abstract": "In this work, we present a complete theoretical framework for analyzing the distribution of polarized hadrons within jets, with and without measuring the transverse momentum relative to the standard jet axis. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we derive the factorization and provide the theoretical calculation of both semi-inclusive and exclusive fragmenting jet functions (FJFs) under longitudinal and transverse polarization. With the polarized FJFs, one gains access to a variety of new observables that can be used for extracting both collinear and transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). As examples, we provide numerical results for the spin asymmetry $A_{TU,T}^{\\cos(\u03c6_S - \\hat\u03c6_{S_h})}$ from polarized semi-inclusive hadron-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions at RHIC kinematics, where a transversely polarized quark would lead to the transverse spin of the final-state hadron inside the jet and is thus sensitive to the transversity fragmentation functions. Similarly, another spin asymmetry, $A_{TU, L}^{\\cos(\u03c6_q - \u03c6_{S})}$ from polarized exclusive hadron-in-jet production in polarized $ep$ collisions at EIC kinematics would allow us to access the helicity fragmentation functions. These observables demonstrate promising potential in investigating transverse momentum dependent PDFs and FFs and are worthwhile for further measurements.",

However, applying traditional RL is challenging in some applications, such as rehabilitation of people with a spinal cord injury (SCI). Among other factors, using RL in this domain is difficult because there are many possible treatments (i.e., large action space) and few patients (i.e., limited training data). Treatments for SCIs have natural groupings, so we propose two approaches to grouping treatments so that an RL agent can learn effectively from limited data. One relies on domain knowledge of SCI rehabilitation and the other learns similarities among treatments using an embedding technique. We then use Fitted Q Iteration to train an agent that learns optimal treatments. Through a simulation study designed to reflect the properties of SCI rehabilitation, we find that both methods can help improve the treatment decisions of physiotherapists, but the approach based on domain knowledge offers better performance. Our findings provide a \"proof of concept\" that RL can be used to help improve the treatment of those with an SCI and indicates that continued efforts to gather data and apply RL to this domain are worthwhile.",

Less surprisingly, classical approaches have been pursued with two prominent algorithms being the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. Latest improvements to quantum computing devices with a specialization in optimization tasks such as DWave systems, suggest that an attempt to embed the problem in a model accepted by such systems is worthwhile. In this work, two QUBO formulations have been proposed, with one being a slight modification over the other. Subsequently, an evaluation based on a few simple test cases had been carried out on both formulations. In this regard, the D-Wave annealers have been used, while providing guidelines for optimality on certain platform-specific concerns. For evaluation purposes, a metric termed Occurrence Ratio (OR) has been defined. With minimal hyperparameter tuning, the expected solutions were obtained for every test case and the optimality was guaranteed. To address practical and implementation issues, an inherent decomposition strategy based on the possibility of having substrings has been elucidated to accommodate the restricted qubit count. Conclusively, the need for further investigation on tuning the hyperparameters is emphasized.",

However, the successful deployment of AI into cybersecurity measures necessitates an in-depth understanding of its capabilities, challenges, and ethical and legal implications to handle associated risk factors in real-world application areas. Towards this, we emphasize the importance of a balanced approach that incorporates AI's computational power with human expertise. AI systems may proactively discover vulnerabilities and detect anomalies through pattern recognition, and predictive modeling, significantly enhancing speed and accuracy. Human experts can explain AI-generated decisions to stakeholders, regulators, and end-users in critical situations, ensuring responsibility and accountability, which helps establish trust in AI-driven security solutions. Therefore, in this position paper, we argue that human-AI teaming is worthwhile in cybersecurity, in which human expertise such as intuition, critical thinking, or contextual understanding is combined with AI's computational power to improve overall cyber defenses.",

Of particular interest to this paper are defenses that provide provable guarantees against the class of $\\ell_p$-bounded attacks. Certified defenses have made significant progress, taking robustness certification from toy models and datasets to large-scale problems like ImageNet classification. While this is undoubtedly an interesting academic problem, as the field has matured, its impact in practice remains unclear, thus we find it useful to revisit the motivation for continuing this line of research. There are three layers to this inquiry, which we address in this paper: (1) why do we care about robustness research? (2) why do we care about the $\\ell_p$-bounded threat model? And (3) why do we care about certification as opposed to empirical defenses? In brief, we take the position that local robustness certification indeed confers practical value to the field of machine learning. We focus especially on the latter two questions from above. With respect to the first of the two, we argue that the $\\ell_p$-bounded threat model acts as a minimal requirement for safe application of models in security-critical domains, while at the same time, evidence has mounted suggesting that local robustness may lead to downstream external benefits not immediately related to robustness. As for the second, we argue that (i) certification provides a resolution to the cat-and-mouse game of adversarial attacks; and furthermore, that (ii) perhaps contrary to popular belief, there may not exist a fundamental trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and certifiability, while moreover, certified training techniques constitute a particularly promising way for learning robust models.",

One of important features that needs to be explained is an apparent contradiction between an extremely high critical temperature Tc and rather modest critical magnetic field Bc and critical current jc reported for LK-99. We show theoretically, that these data may be quantitatively reproduced assuming the interplay between exciton- and phonon-induced superconductivity, while the conventional BCS or Brinkman-Rice-Bardeen-Cooper-Schriefer (BR-BCS) mechanisms would result in a much higher Bc for the same Tc.",

Precedents are the previous legal cases with similar facts, which are the basis for the judgment of the subsequent case in national legal systems. Thus, it is worthwhile to explore the utilization of precedents in the LJP. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled a variety of techniques to be used to solve the LJP task. These can be broken down into two categories: large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific models. LLMs are capable of interpreting and generating complex natural language, while domain models are efficient in learning task-specific information. In this paper, we propose the precedent-enhanced LJP framework (PLJP), a system that leverages the strength of both LLM and domain models in the context of precedents. Specifically, the domain models are designed to provide candidate labels and find the proper precedents efficiently, and the large models will make the final prediction with an in-context precedents comprehension. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our PLJP. Moreover, our work shows a promising direction for LLM and domain-model collaboration that can be generalized to other vertical domains.",

One of the crucial features required for a detector of extensive air showers is the estimation of the primary energy of the events to study the spectra of cosmic and gamma rays. For HAWC there are currently two gamma-ray energy estimators: one relies on a ground density parameter, while the other utilizes an artificial neural network. For the cosmic ray energy estimation, there is only one estimator based on maximum likelihood procedures and measurements of the lateral charge distribution of the events. It is worthwhile to update the cosmic-ray energy estimator due to recent improvements of the extensive air shower offline-reconstruction techniques in HAWC. Therefore, we implemented an artificial neural network to reconstruct the primary energy of hadronic events trained with several observables that characterize the air showers. We trained several models and evaluated their performance against the existing cosmic ray energy estimator. In this work, we present the features and performance of these models.",

The box diagrams responsible for the mixing, which provide the perturbative inputs to the dispersion relations, involve multiple intermediate channels, i.e., the $ut$ and $ct$ channels, $u$ ($c$, $t$) being an up (charm, top) quark, in the $b'$ case, and the $db'$, $sb'$ and $bb'$ ones, $d$ ($s$, $b$) being a down (strange, bottom) quark, in the $t'$ case. The common solutions for the above channels lead to the masses $m_{b'}=(2.7\\pm 0.1)$ TeV and $m_{t'}\\approx 200$ TeV unambiguously. We show that these superheavy quarks, forming bound states in a Yukawa potential, barely contribute to Higgs boson production via gluon fusion and decay to photon pairs, and bypass current experimental constraints. The mass of the $\\bar b'b'$ ground state is estimated to be about 3.2 TeV.

While such proposals are reasonable given the the growing importance of ML, as memory is a pervasive component, %in this work, we make there is a case for a more inclusive PIM design that can accelerate primitives across domains.\n  In this work, we ascertain the capabilities of commercial PIM proposals to accelerate various primitives across domains. We first begin with outlining a set of characteristics, termed PIM-amenability-test, which aid in assessing if a given primitive is likely to be accelerated by PIM. Next, we apply this test to primitives under study to ascertain efficient data-placement and orchestration to map the primitives to underlying PIM architecture. We observe here that, even though primitives under study are largely PIM-amenable, existing commercial PIM proposals do not realize their performance potential for these primitives. To address this, we identify bottlenecks that arise in PIM execution and propose hardware and software optimizations which stand to broaden the acceleration reach of commercial PIM designs (improving average PIM speedups from 1.12x to 2.49x relative to a GPU baseline). Overall, while we believe emerging commercial PIM proposals add a necessary and complementary design point in the application acceleration space, hardware-software co-design is necessary to deliver their benefits broadly.",

An open and worthwhile problem is efficiently adapting such a strong model to the video domain and designing a robust video anomaly detector. In this work, we propose VadCLIP, a new paradigm for weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) by leveraging the frozen CLIP model directly without any pre-training and fine-tuning process. Unlike current works that directly feed extracted features into the weakly supervised classifier for frame-level binary classification, VadCLIP makes full use of fine-grained associations between vision and language on the strength of CLIP and involves dual branch. One branch simply utilizes visual features for coarse-grained binary classification, while the other fully leverages the fine-grained language-image alignment. With the benefit of dual branch, VadCLIP achieves both coarse-grained and fine-grained video anomaly detection by transferring pre-trained knowledge from CLIP to WSVAD task. We conduct extensive experiments on two commonly-used benchmarks, demonstrating that VadCLIP achieves the best performance on both coarse-grained and fine-grained WSVAD, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Specifically, VadCLIP achieves 84.51% AP and 88.02% AUC on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, respectively. Code and features are released at https://github.com/nwpu-zxr/VadCLIP.",

Many existing works aim to reduce the computational and memory complexity of the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer by trading off performance. However, performance is key for the continuing success of the Transformer. In this paper, a family of drop-in replacements for the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer, called the Extractors, is proposed. Four types of the Extractors, namely the super high-performance Extractor (SHE), the higher-performance Extractor (HE), the worthwhile Extractor (WE), and the minimalist Extractor (ME), are proposed as examples. Experimental results show that replacing the self-attention mechanism with the SHE evidently improves the performance of the Transformer, whereas the simplified versions of the SHE, i.e., the HE, the WE, and the ME, perform close to or better than the self-attention mechanism with less computational and memory complexity. Furthermore, the proposed Extractors have the potential or are able to run faster than the self-attention mechanism since their critical paths of computation are much shorter. Additionally, the sequence prediction problem in the context of text generation is formulated using variable-length discrete-time Markov chains, and the Transformer is reviewed based on our understanding.",

First, the latest tactics and techniques including but not limited to X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) particularly necessary for characterising recent honeycomb layered frameworks with metallophilic bilayers are described, with emphasis on silver-based oxides. Second, new strategies and concepts related to topochemically- or temperature-induced cationic-deficient phases expanding the compositional space of honeycomb layered frameworks focused on cationic bilayer architectures are also accentuated. Third, the latest condensed matter theoretic advances towards a full, atomistic description of the bilayered structure in such frameworks are detailed, especially related to critical phenomena at the cusp of the monolayer-bilayer phase transition. This entails, in part, describing honeycomb layered frameworks as optimised lattices within the congruent sphere packing problem, equivalent to a particular two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theory. Altogether, it is hoped that this Review will give the reader a panoramic view of the honeycomb layered frameworks with important applications within the emerging field of quantum matter, potentially redefining their frontier.

    "paper_abstract": "Injecting textual information into knowledge graph (KG) entity representations has been a worthwhile expedition in terms of improving performance in KG oriented tasks within the NLP community. External knowledge often adopted to enhance KG embeddings ranges from semantically rich lexical dependency parsed features to a set of relevant key words to entire text descriptions supplied from an external corpus such as wikipedia and many more. Despite the gains this innovation (Text-enhanced KG embeddings) has made, the proposal in this work suggests that it can be improved even further. Instead of using a single text description (which would not sufficiently represent an entity because of the inherent lexical ambiguity of text), we propose a multi-task framework that jointly selects a set of text descriptions relevant to KG entities as well as align or augment KG embeddings with text descriptions. Different from prior work that plugs formal entity descriptions declared in knowledge bases, this framework leverages a retriever model to selectively identify richer or highly relevant text descriptions to use in augmenting entities. Furthermore, the framework treats the number of descriptions to use in augmentation process as a parameter, which allows the flexibility of enumerating across several numbers before identifying an appropriate number. Experiment results for Link Prediction demonstrate a 5.5% and 3.5% percentage increase in the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hits@10 scores respectively, in comparison to text-enhanced knowledge graph augmentation methods using traditional CNNs.",

Secondly, based on the straight line detection technique, the power of the mutual interference signal in time-frequency domain is accumulated, and the accurate position of the interference is located. Finally, the target echo is recovered by autoregressive model. Compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method has the ability to retain more useful signals after the interference mitigation, and achieve better interference detection robustness under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. Simulation experiments and real scenario experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and show its superiority.",

While detailed spectroscopic comparative study of both components would be worthwhile (e.g., for probing any impact of planet formation on chemical abundances), such a research seems to have been barely attempted as most available studies tend to be biased toward A. Given this situation, the physical properties of A and B along with their differences were investigated based on high-dispersion spectra in order to establish their stellar parameters, evolutionary status, and surface chemical compositions. The following results were obtained. (1) The masses were derived as ~1.7Msun and ~1.6Msun for A and B, respectively, both of which are likely to be in the stage of red clump giants after He-ignition. The mass of the planet around A has also been revised as m*sin(i) = 10.7M_Jupiter (increased by ~20%). (2) These are normal giants of subsolar metallicity ([Fe/H]~-0.4) belonging to the thin-disk population. (3) A as well as B show moderate C deficiency and N enrichment, which are in compatible with the prediction from the standard stellar evolution theory. (4) The chemical abundances of 26 elements are practically the same within <~0.1dex for both components, which implies that the surface chemistry is not appreciably affected by the existence of a planet in A.",

    "paper_abstract": "Quantum adversarial machine learning is an emerging field that studies the vulnerability of quantum learning systems against adversarial perturbations and develops possible defense strategies. Quantum universal adversarial perturbations are small perturbations, which can make different input samples into adversarial examples that may deceive a given quantum classifier. This is a field that was rarely looked into but worthwhile investigating because universal perturbations might simplify malicious attacks to a large extent, causing unexpected devastation to quantum machine learning models. In this paper, we take a step forward and explore the quantum universal perturbations in the context of heterogeneous classification tasks. In particular, we find that quantum classifiers that achieve almost state-of-the-art accuracy on two different classification tasks can be both conclusively deceived by one carefully-crafted universal perturbation. This result is explicitly demonstrated with well-designed quantum continual learning models with elastic weight consolidation method to avoid catastrophic forgetting, as well as real-life heterogeneous datasets from hand-written digits and medical MRI images. Our results provide a simple and efficient way to generate universal perturbations on heterogeneous classification tasks and thus would provide valuable guidance for future quantum learning technologies.",

A safety case for fully autonomous operations is a formal way to explain how a company determines that an AV system is safe enough to be deployed on public roads without a human driver, and it includes evidence to support that determination. It involves an explanation of the system, the methodologies used to develop it, the metrics used to validate it and the actual results of validation tests. Yet, in order to develop a worthwhile safety case, it is first important to understand what makes one credible and well crafted, and align on evaluation criteria. This paper helps enabling such alignment by providing foundational thinking into not only how a system is determined to be ready for deployment but also into justifying that the set of acceptance criteria employed in such determination is sufficient and that their evaluation (and associated methods) is credible. The publication is structured around three complementary perspectives on safety that build upon content published by Waymo since 2020: a layered approach to safety; a dynamic approach to safety; and a credible approach to safety. The proposed approach is methodology-agnostic, so that anyone in the space could employ portions or all of it.",

Even after filtering for tasks the current agent can learn (i.e., learning progress), countless learnable yet uninteresting tasks remain (e.g., minor variations of previously learned tasks). An Achilles Heel of open-endedness research is the inability to quantify (and thus prioritize) tasks that are not just learnable, but also $\\textit{interesting}$ (e.g., worthwhile and novel). We propose solving this problem by $\\textit{Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness}$ (OMNI). The insight is that we can utilize large (language) models (LMs) as a model of interestingness (MoI), because they $\\textit{already}$ internalize human concepts of interestingness from training on vast amounts of human-generated data, where humans naturally write about what they find interesting or boring. We show that LM-based MoIs improve open-ended learning by focusing on tasks that are both learnable $\\textit{and interesting}$, outperforming baselines based on uniform task sampling or learning progress alone. This approach has the potential to dramatically advance the ability to intelligently select which tasks to focus on next (i.e., auto-curricula), and could be seen as AI selecting its own next task to learn, facilitating self-improving AI and AI-Generating Algorithms.

In addition to the study on the tetra-neutron system, it is worthwhile to investigate the correlation in bound systems.\n  Purpose: The $^8$He nucleus is a system where four neutrons are weakly bound around the $^4$He core. The dineutron ($2n$) correlation has been long discussed in various weakly-bound neutron-rich nuclei such as $^6$He and $^{11}$Li, whereas the $^8$He nucleus gives us an opportunity to investigate the $2n$-$2n$ type four-neutron correlation.\n  Methods: We introduce a microscopic $^4{\\rm He}+4n$ model and describe the ground-state structure of $^8$He. The mixing of the two-$2n$ component in the ground state is examined. The ground-state wave function is verified by investigating various observables including high-energy scattering cross sections.\n  Results: Our model reasonably reproduces the available experimental data, the binding energy, charge radius, total reaction cross section, and proton-nucleus elastic scattering cross section data.

We aim to investigate the combination of DR and Near-InfraRed (NIR) DiFC to improve circulating cells' maximum detectable depth and SNR.\n  Approach: Phantom experiments were used to estimate the key parameters in a diffuse fluorescence excitation and emission model. This model and parameters were implemented in Monte-Carlo to simulate DR DiFC while varying noise and autofluorescence parameters to identify the advantages and limitations of the proposed technique.\n  Results: Two key factors must be true to give DR DiFC an advantage over traditional DiFC; first, the fraction of noise that DR methods cannot cancel cannot be above the order of 10% for acceptable SNR. Second, DR DiFC has an advantage, in terms of SNR, if the distribution of tissue autofluorescence contributors is surface-weighted.\n  Conclusions: DR cancelable noise may be designed for (e.g. through the use of source multiplexing), and indications point to the autofluorescence contributors' distribution being truly surface-weighted in-vivo. Successful and worthwhile implementation of DR DiFC depends on these considerations, but results point to DR DiFC having possible advantages over traditional DiFC.",

In practice most of our calculations are carried out using exact diagonalisation techniques (up to $N=24$). Starting with the GUE, we study the resulting behaviour as the randomness is decreased. While in general the system goes from being chaotic to being more ordered as the randomness is decreased, the changes in various properties, including the density of states, the spectral form factor, the level statistics and out-of-time-ordered correlators, reveal interesting patterns. Subject to the limitations of our analysis which is mainly numerical, we find some evidence that the behaviour changes in an abrupt manner when the number of non-zero independent terms in the Hamiltonian is exponentially large in $N$. We also study the opposite limit of much reduced randomness obtained in a local version of the SYK model where the number of couplings scales linearly in $N$, and characterise its behaviour. Our investigation suggests that a more complete theoretical analysis of this class of systems will prove quite worthwhile.",

However, existing research seldom simultaneously models the graphical and sequential structure of HKGs, limiting HKGs' representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hierarchical Attention model for HKG Embedding (HAHE), including global-level and local-level attention. The global-level attention can model the graphical structure of HKG using hypergraph dual-attention layers, while the local-level attention can learn the sequential structure inside H-Facts via heterogeneous self-attention layers.

In addition, HAHE addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for the first time, increasing the applicability of the HKG link prediction task. Our code is publicly available.",

This paper introduces a method that combines evolutionary optimisation with AI-based image classification to perform quality-diversity search, allowing for the creative exploration of complex design spaces. The process begins by randomly sampling the genotype space, followed by mapping the generated phenotypes to a reduced representation of the solution space, as well as evaluating them based on their visual characteristics. This results in an elite group of diverse outcomes that span the solution space. The elite is then progressively updated via sampling and simple mutation. We tested our method on a generative system that produces abstract drawings. The results demonstrate that the system can effectively evolve populations of phenotypes with high aesthetic value and greater visual diversity compared to traditional optimisation-focused evolutionary approaches.",

However, existing methods rarely consider the underlying dynamics knowledge and directly use machine learning algorithms to predict the trajectories. Intuitively, the vessel's motions are following the laws of dynamics, e.g., the speed of a vessel decreases when turning a corner. Yet, it is challenging to combine dynamic knowledge and neural networks due to their inherent heterogeneity. Against this background, we propose MSTFormer, a motion inspired vessel trajectory prediction method based on Transformer. The contribution of this work is threefold. First, we design a data augmentation method to describe the spatial features and motion features of the trajectory. Second, we propose a Multi-headed Dynamic-aware Self-attention mechanism to focus on trajectory points with frequent motion transformations. Finally, we construct a knowledge-inspired loss function to further boost the performance of the model. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our strategy not only effectively improves long-term predictive capability but also outperforms backbones on cornering data.The ablation analysis further confirms the efficacy of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, MSTFormer is the first neural network model for trajectory prediction fused with vessel motion dynamics, providing a worthwhile direction for future research.The source code is available at https://github.com/simple316/MSTFormer.",

Although seldom reported, failure in modeling is not a rare event but I argue that this is usually a result of erroneous underlying knowledge or misapplication of a model beyond its intended purpose. I argue that in many biological studies, simulation is the only experimental tool. In others, simulation is a means of reducing possible combinations of experimental work; thereby, presenting an economical case for simulation; thus, worthwhile to engage in this endeavor. The representativeness of simulation depends on the validation, verification, assumptions, and limitations of the underlying model. This will be illustrated using the inter-relationship between population, samples, probability theory, and statistics.",

    "paper_abstract": "More than one hundred benchmarks have been developed to test the commonsense knowledge and commonsense reasoning abilities of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, these benchmarks are often flawed and many aspects of common sense remain untested. Consequently, we do not currently have any reliable way of measuring to what extent existing AI systems have achieved these abilities. This paper surveys the development and uses of AI commonsense benchmarks. We discuss the nature of common sense; the role of common sense in AI; the goals served by constructing commonsense benchmarks; and desirable features of commonsense benchmarks. We analyze the common flaws in benchmarks, and we argue that it is worthwhile to invest the work needed ensure that benchmark examples are consistently high quality. We survey the various methods of constructing commonsense benchmarks. We enumerate 139 commonsense benchmarks that have been developed: 102 text-based, 18 image-based, 12 video based, and 7 simulated physical environments. We discuss the gaps in the existing benchmarks and aspects of commonsense reasoning that are not addressed in any existing benchmark. We conclude with a number of recommendations for future development of commonsense AI benchmarks.",

    "paper_authors": ["Emily Dolson"],
    "paper_abstract": "Calculating the probability of an individual solution being selected under lexicase selection is an important problem in attempts to develop a deeper theoretical understanding of lexicase selection, a state-of-the art parent selection algorithm in evolutionary computation. Discovering a fast solution to this problem would also have implications for efforts to develop practical improvements to lexicase selection. Here, I prove that this problem, which I name lex-prob, is NP-Hard. I achieve this proof by reducing SAT, a well-known NP-Complete problem, to lex-prob in polynomial time. This reduction involves an intermediate step in which a popular variant of lexicase selection, epsilon-lexicase selection, is reduced to standard lexicase selection. This proof has important practical implications for anyone needing a fast way of calculating the probabilities of individual solutions being selected under lexicase selection. Doing so in polynomial time would be incredibly challenging, if not all-together impossible. Thus, finding approximation algorithms or practical optimizations for speeding up the brute-force solution is likely more worthwhile. This result also has deeper theoretical implications about the relationship between epsilon-lexicase selection and lexicase selection and the relationship between lex-prob and other NP-Hard problems.",

    "paper_abstract": "The muon $g-2$ is a compelling quantity due to the current standing tensions among the experimental average, data-driven theoretical results, and lattice results. Matching the final target accuracy of the experiments at Fermilab and J-PARC will constitute a major challenge for the lattice community in the coming years. For this reason, it is worthwhile to consider different options to keep the systematic errors under control. In this proceedings, we discuss finite-volume effects of the leading Hadron Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$ in the presence of C$^{\\star}$ boundary conditions. When considering isospin-breaking corrections to the HVP, C$^{\\star}$ boundary conditions provide a possible consistent formulation of $\\mathrm{QCD+QED}$ in finite volume. Even though these boundary conditions can be avoided in the calculation of the leading HVP contribution, we find the interesting result that they remove the leading exponential finite-volume correction. In practice, compared to the periodic case, C$^{\\star}$ boundary conditions cut the finite-size effects in half on a lattice of physical size $M_\u03c0L=4$ and by a factor of almost ten for $M_\u03c0L=8$. We discuss the origin of this reduction and implications for computational efficiency.",

In this work, we revisit the AGN contribution to reionization given the high number densities associated with these objects. We use the DELPHI semi-analytic model, base-lined against the latest high-redshift datasets from the JWST and the Atacama Large millimetre Array (ALMA) to model early star forming galaxies and AGN. We calculate the escape fractions of ionizing radiation from both star formation and AGN and include the impact of reionization feeback in suppressing the baryonic content of low-mass galaxies in ionized regions. This model is validated against the key observables for star forming galaxy, AGN and reionization. In our {\\it fiducial} model, reionization reaches its mid-point at $z \\sim 6.9$ and ends by $z \\sim 5.9$. Low stellar mass ($M_*\\leq 10^9M_\\odot$) star forming galaxies are found to be the key drivers of the reionization process, providing about $77\\%$ of the total photon budget. Despite their high numbers, high accretion rates and higher escape fractions compared to star forming galaxies at $z \\sim 5$, AGN only provide about $23\\%$ of the total reionization budget which is dominated by black holes in high stellar mass systems (with $M_* \\geq 10^9M_\\odot$). This is because AGN number densities become relevant only at $z \\leq 7$ - as a result, AGN contribute as much as galaxies as late as $z \\sim 6.2$, when reionization is already in its end stages. Finally, we find that even contrasting models of the AGN ionizing photon escape fraction (increasing or decreasing with stellar mass) do not qualitatively change our results.",

    "paper_abstract": "Context. The transition from the spherically symmetric envelopes around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars to the asymmetric morphologies observed in planetary nebulae is still not well understood, and the shaping mechanisms are a subject of debate. Even though binarity is widely accepted as a promising option. Recently, the presence of ultraviolet excesses in AGB stars has been suggested as a potential indicator of binarity. Aims. Our main goals are to characterise the properties of the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) around candidate AGB binary stars, specifically those selected based on their UV excess emission, and to compare these properties with those derived from previous CO-based studies of AGB stars. Methods. We observed the 12CO ($J$=1-0) and 12CO ($J$=2-1) millimetre-wavelength emission in a sample of 29 AGB binary candidates with the IRAM-30 m antenna. We explored different trends between the envelope parameters deduced and compared them with those previously derived from larger samples of AGB stars found in the literature. Results. We derived the average excitation temperature and column density of the CO-emitting layers, which we used to estimate self-consistently the average mass-loss rate and the CO photodissociation radius of our targets. We find a correlation between CO intensity and IRAS 60$\u03bc$m fluxes, revealing a CO-to-IRAS 60$\u03bc$m ratio lower than for AGB stars and closer to that found for pre-planetary nebulae (pPNe). Conclusions. For the first time we have studied the mass-loss properties of UV-excess AGB binary candidates and estimated their main CSE parameters. The different relationships between 12CO and IRAS 60\u03bcm, with NUV and FUV are consistent with an intrinsic origin of NUV emission, but potential dominance of an extrinsic process (e.g. presence of a binary companion) in FUV emission.",

To address this issue comprehensively, we propose an advanced Bayesian hierarchical framework of latent Gaussian models with spatial components. Our model provides a thorough diagnostic analysis, pinpointing areas exhibiting unexpectedly high rutting rates. Incorporating spatial and random components, and important explanatory variables like annual average daily traffic (traffic intensity), pavement type, rut depth and lane width, our proposed models account for and estimate the influence of these variables on rutting. This approach not only quantifies uncertainties and discerns locations at the highest risk of requiring maintenance, but also uncover spatial dependencies in rutting (millimetre/year). We apply our models to a data set spanning eleven years (2010-2020). Our findings emphasize the systematic unexpected spatial rutting effect, where more of the rutting variability is explained by including spatial components. Pavement type, in conjunction with traffic intensity, is also found to be the primary driver of rutting. Furthermore, the spatial dependencies uncovered reveal road sections experiencing more than 1 millimeter of rutting beyond annual expectations. This leads to a halving of the expected pavement lifespan in these areas. Our study offers valuable insights, presenting maps indicating expected rutting, and identifying locations with accelerated rutting rates, resulting in a reduction in pavement life expectancy of at least 10 years.",

A catalogue of 850 $\u03bc$m sources in the SSA22 field is generated, identifying 390 sources with single-to-noise ratios above 3.5, out of which 92 sources exceed 5$\u03c3$. The derived intrinsic number counts at 850 $\u03bc$m are found to be in excellent agreement with published surveys. Interestingly, the SSA22 number counts also exhibit an upturn in the brighter flux region, likely attributed to local emitters or lensing objects within the field. On the scale of $\\sim$ 0.3 deg$^2$, the 850 $\u03bc$m number counts are unaffected by cosmic variance and align with the blank field. In the deep region ($\u03c3_\\text{rms}$ $\\leqslant$ 1 mJy), the counts for fluxes below 8 mJy are consistent with the blank field, and the excess in the brighter regime is not significant. Due to the limited number of very bright sources and the insubstantial cosmic variance in our field, we attribute the fluctuations in the number counts primarily to Poisson noise. The SCUBA-2 850 $\u03bc$m detection in the SSA22 field does not exhibit indications of overdensity.",

To better understand the system, we develop a theoretical model that couples acoustic driving with the fluid mechanics of a spreading drop. An important feature of the problem is that the strength of the acoustic driving depends on the fluid thickness, with strong attenuation of the forcing in regions of the domain covered by fluid. The presented model provides results consistent with the experiments, particularly regarding drop height and spreading speed. The constant spreading speed observed in the experiments is also captured by an approximate traveling-wave solution, which provides predictions for the dependence of drop thickness and spreading speed on the acoustic amplitude.",

Our observations demonstrate that the HCN-to-CO line ratio is a sensitive tracer of gas density in agreement with findings of recent Galactic studies which utilize N$_2$H$^+$. The peculiar line ratios present near the AGN and the scatter of the power-law fit in the disk suggest that in addition to a first-order correlation with gas density, second-order physics (such as optical depth, gas temperature) or chemistry (abundance variations) are encoded in the N$_2$H$^+$/CO, HCN/CO and N$_2$H$^+$/HCN ratios.",

The key intuition behind the waveSLAM design is that while the mobile robots moves freely, the mmWave radios can periodically exchange angle and distance estimates between themselves (self-sensing) by bouncing the signal from the environment, thus enabling accurate estimates of the target object/material surface. Our experiments verify that waveSLAM can archive cm-level accuracy with errors below 22 cm and 20deg in angle orientation which is compatible with Lidar when building indoor maps.",

We aim to explore the nature of the inner subparsec jet of BL Lac and the impact of the NOEMA participation in the observation. For the data reduction, we employed two advanced automatic pipelines: rPICARD for the flux density calibration as well as the model-agnostic signal stabilization and GPCAL for the antenna leakage calibration. The conventional hybrid imaging (CLEAN + amplitude and phase self-calibration) was applied to the calibrated visibilities to generate final VLBI images. We performed a ridge-line analysis and Gaussian model-fits on the final jet image to derive the jet parameters. In our data, the presence of NOEMA improves the image sensitivity by a factor of 2.5. The jet shows a clear wiggling structure within 0.4 mas from the core. Our ridge-line analysis suggests the presence of a helical jet structure (i.e., a sinusoidal pattern). Six circular Gaussian components were fitted to the inner jet region. We estimated an apparent brightness temperature of $\\sim$3 $\\times$ 10$^{12}$ K in the two innermost components. They are likely to be highly boosted by relativistic beaming effect. We find four significant polarized knots in the jet. Interestingly, two of them are located in the core region.

By combining chemical rate networks with continuum & line radiative transfer, and the calculation of all relevant dust and gas heating & cooling rates in an axisymmetric disc structure, these models make detailed predictions about the molecular composition of the disc, the discs' internal gas and dust temperature structure, and the composition of ice layers which form on the refractory dust grain surfaces. The development of ProDiMo was a process that took about 15 years. I have started the ProDiMo project and am the main developer, but without the involvement of an international team of scientists, in particular Inga Kamp, Wing-Fai Thi and Christian Rab, ProDiMo would not have its capabilities and would not be at the level of international recognition that is has achieved to date.\n  Using formal solutions of the line & continuum radiative transfer, we can predict the spectral appearance of these discs from optical to millimetre wavelengths, for example the continuum and line fluxes, monochromatic images, radial intensity profiles, high-resolution line profiles that probe the disc dynamics, visibilities and channel maps. A large part of this thesis describes the publications that compared these predictions to disc observations that have been obtained by various space-borne and ground-based astronomical instruments, in particular Herschel/PACS, Spitzer/IRS, VLT/CRIRES, JWST/MIRI and ALMA. These observations probe the gas and the dust in different radial disc regions and in different layers above the midplane.

We use measurements of nuclear millimetre continuum emission along with other archival tracers of AGN accretion/activity to investigate previous claims that at, circumnuclear scales (<100 pc), these should correlate with the mass of the cold molecular gas. We find that the molecular gas mass does not correlate with any tracer of nuclear activity. This suggests the level of nuclear activity cannot solely be regulated by the amount of cold gas around the supermassive black hole (SMBH). This indicates that AGN fuelling, that drives gas from the large scale galaxy to the nuclear regions, is not a ubiquitous process and may vary between AGN type, with timescale variations likely to be very important. By studying the structure of the central molecular gas reservoirs, we find our galaxies have a range of nuclear molecular gas concentrations. This could indicate that some of our galaxies may have had their circumnuclear regions impacted by AGN feedback, even though they currently have low nuclear activity. On the other hand, the nuclear molecular gas concentrations in our galaxies could instead be set by secular processes.",

The density conditions and the lifetimes of collapsing envelopes have proven unfavorable for the growth of solids up to millimetre sizes. As an alternative, magneto-hydrodynamical simulations suggest that protostellar jets and outflows might lift grains from circumstellar discs and diffuse them in the envelope. We reframe available data for the CALYPSO sample of Class 0/I sources and show tentative evidence for an anti-correlation between the value of $\u03b2_{1-3mm}$ measured in the inner envelope and the mass loss rate of their jets and outflows, supporting a connection between the two. We discuss the implications that dust transport from the disc to the inner envelope might have for several aspects of planet formation. Finally, we urge for more accurate measurements of both correlated quantities and extension of this work to larger samples, necessary to further test the transport scenario.",

The MIRO data are analysed with thermophysical and radiative transfer models. The pre-collapse observations are consistent with a 30 MKS thermal inertia dust mantle with a thickness of at least 3 cm. The post-collapse data are consistent with: 1) a dust/water-ice mass ratio of 0.9$\\pm$0.5 and a molar $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ abundance of ~30 per cent relative to water; 2) formation of a dust mantle after ~7 months, having a thickness of a few millimetres or a fraction thereof; 3) a $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ ice sublimation front at 0.4 cm that withdrew to 2.0 cm and later to 20$\\pm$6 cm; 4) a thermal inertia ranging 10-45 MKS; 5) a gas diffusivity that decreased from $0.1\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$ to $0.001\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$; 6) presence of a solid-state greenhouse effect parts of the time.

We present maps and complex models of 12CO and 13CO J=2-1 emission lines for four objects: AC Herculis, 89 Herculis, IRAS 19125+0343, and R Scuti. Our maps and models allow us to study their morphology, kinematics, and mass distribution. Our maps and modeling of AC Her reveal that 95% of the total nebular mass is located in the disk. So this source is a disk-dominated source (like the Red Rectangle, IW Carinae, IRAS 08544-4431). On the contrary, our maps and modeling of 89 Herculis, IRAS 19125+0343, and R Scuti suggest that the outflow is the dominant component of the nebula, resulting in a new subclass nebulae around binary post-AGB stars: the outflow-dominated ones. Besides CO, the molecular content of this kind of sources was barely known. We also present the first and very deep single-dish radio molecular survey in the 1.3, 2, 3, 7, and 13 mm bands. Our results allow us to classify our sources as O- or C-rich. We also conclude that these sources present in general a low molecular richness, especially those that are disk-dominated, compared to circumstellar envelopes around AGB stars and other post-AGB stars.\n  This thesis presents a comprehensive study at millimetre wavelengths. On the one hand, we perform a detailed kinetic study of these objects through NOEMA interferometric observations and complex models. On the other hand, we study the chemistry of these sources, thanks to our sensitive single-dish observations.\n  The union of these different methods yields a comprehensive study of the molecular gas present in these sources. Hopefully, this Ph.D. thesis will become a reference for future studies of molecular gas in nebulae around binary post-AGB stars.",

    "paper_abstract": "Multiwavelength dust continuum and polarization observations arising from self-scattering have been used to investigate grain sizes in young disks. However, the polarization by self-scattering is low in face-on optically thick disks and puts some of the size constraints from polarization on hold, particularly for the younger and more massive disks. The 1.3 mm emission detected toward the hot ($\\gtrsim$400 K) Class 0 disk IRAS 16293-2422 B has been attributed to self-scattering, predicting grain sizes between 200-2000 $\u03bc$m. We investigate the effects of grain size in the resultant flux and polarization fractions from self-scattering using a hot and massive Class 0 disk model and compare with observations. We compared new and archival high-resolution observations between 1.3 and 18 mm to a set of synthetic models. We have developed a new public tool to automate this process called Synthesizer. This is an easy-to-use program to generate synthetic observations from numerical simulations. Optical depths are in the range of 130 to 2 from 1.3 to 18 mm, respectively. Predictions from significant grain growth populations, including millimetric grains are comparable to the observations at all wavelengths. The polarization fraction produced by self-scattering reaches a maximum of $\\sim$0.1% at 1.3 mm for a maximum grain size of 100 $\u03bc$m, being an order of magnitude lower than that observed with ALMA. From the comparison of Stokes I fluxes, we conclude that significant grain growth could be present in the young Class 0 disk IRAS 16293 B, particularly in the inner hot region ($<10$ au, $T>$ 300 K) where refractory organics evaporate. The polarization produced by self-scattering in our model is not high enough to explain the observations at 1.3 and 7 mm, and effects like dichroic extinction or polarization reversal of elongated aligned grains remain other possible but untested scenarios.",

The nanowires possess high critical currents and fields, making them a natural choice for magnetomotive actuation and sensing. This fabrication technique is independent of the substrate material, dimensions and layout and can readily be adapted to fabricate nanowire resonators from any metal or alloy with suitable ductility and yield strength.

The study of protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understand their evolution and interaction with the surrounding environment, and to constrain planet formation mechanisms.\n  Aims. We aim at characterising the young binary system HD 34700 A, which shows a wealth of structures.\n  Methods. Taking advantage of the high-contrast imaging instruments SPHERE at the VLT, LMIRCam at the LBT, and of ALMA observations, we analyse this system at multiple wavelengths. We study the rings and spiral arms morphology and the scattering properties of the dust. We discuss the possible causes of all the observed features.\n  Results. We detect for the first time, in the H$\u03b1$ band, a ring extending from $\\sim$65 au to ${\\sim}$120 au, inside the ring already known from recent studies. These two have different physical and geometrical properties. Based on the scattering properties, the outer ring may consist of grains of typical size $a_{out} > 4 \u03bcm$, while the inner ring of smaller grains ($a_{in} <= 0.4 {\u03bcm}$). Two extended logarithmic spiral arms stem from opposite sides of the disk. The outer ring appears as a spiral arm itself, with a variable radial distance from the centre and extended substructures. ALMA data confirm the presence of a millimetric dust substructure centred just outside the outer ring, and detect misaligned gas rotation patterns for HD 34700 A and B.\n  Conclusions. The complexity of HD 34700 A, revealed by the variety of observed features, suggests the existence of one or more disk-shaping physical mechanisms. Possible scenarios, compatible with our findings, involve the presence inside the disk of a yet undetected planet of several Jupiter masses and the system interaction with the surroundings by means of gas cloudlet capture or flybys. Further observations with JWST/MIRI or ALMA (gas kinematics) could shed more light on these.",

Macroscopic particles ultimately exhibit diffusive motion when their energy exceeds the characteristic potential barrier of the random landscape. In stark contrast, wave-particle duality causes subatomic particles in disordered media to come to rest even when the potential is weak -- a remarkable phenomenon known as Anderson localization. Here, we present a hydrodynamic active system with wave-particle features, a millimetric droplet self-guided by its own wave field over a submerged random topography, whose dynamics exhibits localized statistics analogous to those of quantum systems. Consideration of an ensemble of particle trajectories reveals a suppression of diffusion when the guiding wave field extends over the disordered topography. We rationalize mechanistically the emergent statistics by virtue of the wave-mediated resonant coupling between the droplet and topography, which produces an attractive wave potential about the localization region. This hydrodynamic analog, which demonstrates how a classical particle may localize like a wave, suggests new directions for future research in various areas, including wave localization, many-body localization, and topological matter.",

It has been questioned whether M-dwarf discs are simply less common than earlier types, or whether the low detection rate derives from the wavelengths and sensitivities available to those studies. The highly sensitive, long wavelength Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array can shed light on the problem. This paper presents a survey of M-dwarf stars in the young and nearby Beta Pictoris Moving Group with ALMA at Band 7 (880\\,$\u03bc$m). From the observational sample we detect two new sub-mm excesses that likely constitute unresolved debris discs around GJ\\,2006\\,A and AT\\,Mic\\,A and model distributions of the disc fractional luminosities and temperatures. From the science sample of 36 M-dwarfs including AU\\,Mic we find a disc detection rate of 4/36 or 11.1$^{+7.4}_{-3.3}$\\% that rises to 23.1$^{+8.3}_{-5.5}$\\% when adjusted for completeness. We conclude that this detection rate is consistent with the detection rate of discs around G and K type stars and that the disc properties are also likely consistent with earlier type stars. We additionally conclude that M-dwarf stars are not less likely to host debris discs, but instead their detection requires longer wavelength and higher sensitivity observations than have previously been employed.",

One of the major factors that the accuracy of a particular position estimate depends on is the geometry of the nodes in the system, which could be measured with the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP). Hence in this paper, we investigate the time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements based UE positioning accuracy improvement, exploiting the geometric distribution of BSs in mixed LOS and NLOS environment. We propose a BS selection algorithm for UE positioning based on the GDOP of the BSs participating in the positioning process.

First, various thermophysical models are used to calculate gas production for a few sets of parameters. Second, a comparison of observations and theoretical predictions is performed. This approach is complicated because the values of many model characteristics are known only approximately. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the sensitivity of the simulated outgassing to variations in the properties of the surface layer. This problem was recently considered by us for aggregates up to tens of microns in size. For millimetre-size aggregates, a qualitative extension of the method used to model the structural characteristics of the layer is required. It is also necessary to study the role of radiative thermal conductivity, which may play an important role for such large particles. We investigated layers constructed from large aggregates and having various thicknesses and porosity and evaluated the effective sublimation of water ice at different heliocentric distances. For radiative conductivity, approximate commonly used models and the complicated model based on the Dense Medium Radiative Transfer theory were compared. It was shown that for millimetre-size aggregates careful consideration of the radiative thermal conductivity is required since this mechanism of energy transfer may change the resulting gas productivity by several times. We demonstrate that our model is more realistic for an evolved comet than simple models parameterising the properties of the cometary surface layer, yet maintains comparable computational complexity.",

In this study, we develop a new technique, called the PCFilt-94 algorithm, to extract 3D point clouds from coarse resolution millimetre-wave radar data cubes and quantify their associated uncertainties. A technique to non-coherently average neighbouring waveforms surrounding each AVTIS2 range profile was developed in order to reduce speckle and was found to reduce point cloud uncertainty by 13% at long range and 20% at short range. Further, a Voronoi-based point cloud outlier removal algorithm was implemented which iteratively removes outliers in a point cloud until the process converges to the removal of 0 points. Taken together, the new processing methodology produces a stable point cloud, which means that: 1) it is repeatable even when using different point cloud extraction and filtering parameter values during pre-processing, and 2) is less sensitive to over-filtering through the point cloud processing workflow. Using an optimal number of Ground Control Points (GCPs) for georeferencing, which was determined to be 3 at close range (<1.5 km) and 5 at long range (>3 km), point cloud uncertainty was estimated to be approximately 1.5 m at 1.5 km to 3 m at 3 km and followed a Lorentzian distribution. These uncertainties are smaller than those reported for other close-range radar systems used for terrain mapping. The results of this study should be used as a benchmark for future application of millimetre-wave radar systems for 3D terrain mapping.",

Our method allows us to get the following dust parameters: dust mass, average interstellar radiation field, and fraction of small grains. Also, it is effective in retrieving the intrinsic correlations between dust parameters and interstellar medium properties. We find an evident anti-correlation between the interstellar radiation field and the fraction of small grains in the centre of NGC4254, meaning that, at strong radiation field intensities, very small amorphous carbon grains are efficiently destroyed by the ultra-violet photons coming from newly formed stars, through photo-desorption and sublimation.

We aim to extend the limited line lists of the main isotopologue of isobutene from the microwave to the millimetre region in order to obtain a highly precise set of rest frequencies and to facilitate its detection in the interstellar medium. We investigated the rotational spectrum of isobutene in the 35$-$370 GHz range using absorption spectroscopy at room temperature. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out to evaluate vibrational frequencies. We determined new or improved spectroscopic parameters for isobutene up to a sixth-order distortion constant. These new results enabled its detection in the G+0.693 molecular cloud for the first time, where propene was also recently found. The propene to isobutene column density ratio was determined to be about 3:1. The observed spectroscopic parameters for isobutene are sufficiently accurate that calculated transition frequencies should be reliable up to 700 GHz. This will further help in observing this alkene in other, warmer regions of the ISM.",

    "paper_abstract": "Recent advances in technology coupled with the progress of observational radio astronomy methods resulted in achieving a major milestone of astrophysics - a direct image of the shadow of a supermassive black hole, taken by the Earth-based Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The EHT was able to achieve a resolution of $\\sim$20 $\u03bc$as, enabling it to resolve the shadows of the black holes in the centres of two celestial objects: the supergiant elliptical galaxy M87 and the Milky Way Galaxy. The EHT results mark the start of a new round of development of next generation Very Long Baseline Interferometers (VLBI) which will be able to operate at millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths. The inclusion of baselines exceeding the diameter of the Earth and observation at as short a wavelength as possible is imperative for further development of high resolution astronomical observations. This can be achieved by a spaceborne VLBI system. We consider the preliminary mission design of such a system, specifically focused on the detection and analysis of photon rings, an intrinsic feature of supermassive black holes. Optimised Earth, Sun-Earth L2 and Earth-Moon L2 orbit configurations for the space interferometer system are presented, all of which provide an order of magnitude improvement in resolution compared to the EHT. Such a space-borne interferometer would be able to conduct a comprehensive survey of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei and enable uniquely robust and accurate tests of strong gravity, through detection of the photon ring features.",

Methods: The A$^3$COSMOS survey utilizes all publicly available ALMA data in the COSMOS field, therefore having inhomogeneous coverage in terms of observing wavelength and depth. In order to derive the luminosity functions and star formation rate densities, we apply a newly developed method that corrects the statistics of an inhomogeously sampled survey of individual pointings to those representing an unbiased blind survey. Results: We find our sample to mostly consist of massive ($M_{\\star} \\sim 10^{10} - 10^{12}$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$), IR-bright ($L_* \\sim 10^{11}-10^{13.5} \\rm L_{\\odot}$), highly star-forming (SFR $\\sim 100-1000$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ $\\rm yr^{-1}$) galaxies. We find an evolutionary trend in the typical density ($\u03a6^*$) and luminosity ($L^*$) of the galaxy population, which decrease and increase with redshift, respectively. Our IR LF is in agreement with previous literature results and we are able to extend to high redshift ($z > 3$) the constraints on the knee and bright-end of the LF, derived by using the Herschel data. Finally, we obtain the SFRD up to $z\\sim 6$ by integrating the IR LF, finding a broad peak from $z \\sim 1$ to $z \\sim 3$ and a decline towards higher redshifts, in agreement with recent IR/mm-based studies, within the uncertainties, thus implying the presence of larger quantities of dust than what is expected by optical/UV studies.",

However, as a Radio Frequency (RF) based technology, mmWave radars rely on capturing reflected signals from objects, making them more prone to noise compared to cameras. This raises an intriguing question for the deep learning community: Can we develop more effective point set-based deep learning methods for such attractive sensors?\n  To answer this question, our work, termed MiliPoint, delves into this idea by providing a large-scale, open dataset for the community to explore how mmWave radars can be utilised for human activity recognition. Moreover, MiliPoint stands out as it is larger in size than existing datasets, has more diverse human actions represented, and encompasses all three key tasks in human activity recognition. We have also established a range of point-based deep neural networks such as DGCNN, PointNet++ and PointTransformer, on MiliPoint, which can serve to set the ground baseline for further development.",

To go beyond these limitations and spur further research, we introduce the SHOWMe dataset which consists of 96 videos, annotated with real and detailed hand-object 3D textured meshes. Following recent work, we consider a rigid hand-object scenario, in which the pose of the hand with respect to the object remains constant during the whole video sequence. This assumption allows us to register sub-millimetre-precise groundtruth 3D scans to the image sequences in SHOWMe. Although simpler, this hypothesis makes sense in terms of applications where the required accuracy and level of detail is important eg., object hand-over in human-robot collaboration, object scanning, or manipulation and contact point analysis. Importantly, the rigidity of the hand-object systems allows to tackle video-based 3D reconstruction of unknown hand-held objects using a 2-stage pipeline consisting of a rigid registration step followed by a multi-view reconstruction (MVR) part. We carefully evaluate a set of non-trivial baselines for these two stages and show that it is possible to achieve promising object-agnostic 3D hand-object reconstructions employing an SfM toolbox or a hand pose estimator to recover the rigid transforms and off-the-shelf MVR algorithms. However, these methods remain sensitive to the initial camera pose estimates which might be imprecise due to lack of textures on the objects or heavy occlusions of the hands, leaving room for improvements in the reconstruction.

The physical origin of their radio emission remains then broadly unclear. The observation of flat/inverted radio spectra at GHz frequencies seems to support however the presence of an unresolved synchrotron self-absorbed region in the close environment of the supermassive black hole. Its size could be as small as that of the X-ray corona. Since synchrotron self absorption decreases strongly with frequency, these sources need to be observed in the millimetric (mm) domain. We report here a 12h simultaneous mm-X-ray observation of the RQ AGN MCG+08-11-11 by NOEMA and NuSTAR. The mm flux shows a weak but clear increase along the pointing with a fractional variability of $2.0\\pm0.1$\\%. The 3-10 keV flux of NuSTAR also increases and shows a fractional variability of $7.0\\pm1.5$\\%. A structure function analysis shows a local maximum in the mm light curve corresponding to 2-3\\% of variability on timescale of $\\sim2\\times10^4$ seconds (100-300 $R_g$ light crossing time). Assuming an optically thick mm emitting medium, this translates into an upper limit of its size of $\\sim$1300 $R_g$. The observation of fast variability in radio-mm and X-ray wavelengths, as well as a similar variability trend, well support the mm emission to be emitted by a region close, and potentially related to, the X-ray corona like an outflow/weak jet.",

This contrasts with microscopic colloidal self-assembly where thermal fluctuations excite transitions between geometrically distinct ground-state configurations. We herein utilize supercritical Faraday waves to drive structural rearrangements between metastable states of few-particle clusters of millimetric spheres bound by capillary attractions at the fluid interface. Using a combination of experiments and theoretical modelling, we demonstrate how the occupation probabilities of different cluster topologies and transition statistics are controlled by the level of the vibrational forcing and the spatial extent of long-range capillary forces. Our results demonstrate how self-assembly dynamics and statistics may be manipulated across scales by controlling the strength of fluctuations and by tuning the properties of the particle interaction-potential.",

Follow-up ALMA campaigns have so far found one potential lens candidate, but without clear compelling evidence e.g. from lensing arcs. Here we report the discovery of a compelling gravitational lens system confirming the lensing population predictions, with a $z_{s} = 3.4 {\\pm} 0.4$ submm source lensed by a $z_{spec} = 0.360$ foreground galaxy within the COSMOS field, identified through public JWST imaging of a $450\u03bc$m source in the SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging EAO Survey (STUDIES) catalogue. These systems will typically be well within the detectable range of future wide-field surveys such as Euclid and Roman, and since sub-millimetre galaxies are predominantly very red at optical/near-infrared wavelengths, they will tend to appear in near-infrared channels only. Extrapolating to the Euclid-Wide survey, we predict tens of thousands of strongly lensed near-infrared galaxies. This will be transformative for the study of dusty star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon, but will be a contaminant population in searches for strongly lensed ultra-high-redshift galaxies in Euclid and Roman.",

To generate synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that include dust absorption, re-emission, and scattering, Monte Carlo radiative transfer is often used in post-processing on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. However, this is computationally expensive, especially if one wants to make predictions for suites of many cosmological simulations. To alleviate this computational burden, we have developed a radiative transfer emulator using an artificial neural network (ANN), ANNgelina, that can reliably predict SEDs of simulated galaxies using a small number of integrated properties of the simulated galaxies: star formation rate, stellar and dust masses, and mass-weighted metallicities of all star particles and of only star particles with age <10 Myr. Here, we present the methodology and quantify the accuracy of the predictions. We train the ANN on SEDs computed for galaxies from the IllustrisTNG project's TNG50 cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation. ANNgelina is able to predict the SEDs of TNG50 galaxies in the ultraviolet (UV) to millimetre regime with a typical median absolute error of ~7 per cent. The prediction error is the greatest in the UV, possibly due to the viewing-angle dependence being greatest in this wavelength regime. Our results demonstrate that our ANN-based emulator is a promising computationally inexpensive alternative for forward-modeling galaxy SEDs from cosmological simulations.",

A primary focus that could shed more light on these questions is the study of merging systems, comprising highly star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the earliest stages of galactic formation. However, it is essential to explore complementary selection methods across multiple wavelengths. The primary objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a sample of high-redshift ($z>3$) far-infrared (far-IR) and radio-emitting galaxies in the highest possible spatial resolution. In order to select the galactic population of our interest, we selected galaxies that present relatively compact radio morphologies at 1.4 GHz as well as a far-IR spectrum that peaks in flux at $\u03bb\\geq 350 \\, \u03bcm$. For these selection criteria, we used the COSMOS and ECDF-S fields, which provide high spectral and spatial resolution at a multi-wavelength scale. We derived a sample of eight galaxies that were identified either photometrically or spectroscopically at $z>3$ from literature studies and by our team. A thorough investigation of available optical, near-IR, and millimetre (mm) imaging reveals a possible merging scenario in five out of eight cases in our sample. Additionally, available multi-wavelength photometry strongly suggests active star formation at the $10^3 \\, M_{\\odot}/yr$ level in massive systems co-hosting an active SMBH. Comparison of these results with previous studies, suggests that our selection method preferentially identifies galaxies hosting an active SMBH, as well as a strong SFG component, resulting in high SFR and IR luminosity.",

The millimetre continuum emission, observed at an angular resolution of 20 milliarcsec (corresponding to 70 AU), reveals a bright compact central component whose spectral index indicates that it composed of amorphous carbon dust. Based on these findings, we conclude that this emission traces the previously suggested dust disc observed in mid-infrared observations. Therefore, our observations provide the first direct imaging of such a disc. The H$^{12}$CN($J$=4$\\rightarrow$3) line emission, observed at an angular resolution of 300 milliarcsec (corresponding to 1000 AU), displays bipolar structure with a north-south velocity gradient. From the position-velocity diagram of this emission we identify the presence of an expanding disc and a bipolar molecular outflow. The inclination of the disc is determined to be $i$=72$^\\circ$. The derived values for the de-projected expansion velocity and the radius of the disc are $v_{\\rm exp}$=53 km s$^{-1}$ and $R$=277 AU, respectively. On the other hand, the de-projected expansion velocity of the bipolar outflow detected in the H$^{12}$CN($J$=4$\\rightarrow$3) emission of approximately 1000 km s$^{-1}$. We propose that the molecular outflow has an hourglass morphology with an opening angle of around 60$^{\\circ}$. Our observations unambiguously show that an equatorial disc and bipolar outflows formed in Sakurai's object in less than 30 years after the born-again event occurred, providing important constraints for future modelling efforts of this phenomenon.",

    "paper_abstract": "The composition of a forming planet is set by the material it accretes from its parent protoplanetary disk. Therefore, it is crucial to map the chemical make-up of the gas in disks to understand the chemical environment of planet formation. This paper presents molecular line observations taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of the planet-hosting disk around the young star HD 169142. We detect N2H+, CH3OH, [CI], DCN, CS, C34S, 13CS, H2CS, H2CO, HC3N and c-C3H2 in this system for the first time. Combining these data with the recent detection of SO and previously published DCO+ data, we estimate the location of H2O and CO snowlines and investigate radial variations in the gas phase C/O ratio. We find that the HD 169142 disk has a relatively low N2H+ flux compared to the disks around Herbig stars HD 163296 and MWC 480 indicating less CO freeze-out and place the CO snowline beyond the millimetre disk at ~150 au. The detection of CH3OH from the inner disk is consistent with the H2O snowline being located at the edge of the central dust cavity at ~20 au. The radially varying CS/SO ratio across the proposed H2O snowline location is consistent with this interpretation. Additionally, the detection of CH3OH in such a warm disk adds to the growing evidence supporting the inheritance of complex ices in disks from the earlier, colder stages of star formation. Finally, we propose that the giant HD 169142 b located at 37 au is forming between the CO2 and H2O snowlines where the local elemental make of the gas is expected to have C/O=1.0.",

    "paper_abstract": "Neutron stars accreting from OB supergiants are often divided between persistently and transiently accreting systems, called Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SgXBs) and Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). This dichotomy in accretion behaviour is typically attributed to systematic differences in the massive stellar wind, binary orbit, or magnetic field configuration, but direct observational evidence for these hypotheses remains sparse. To investigate their stellar winds, we present the results of pilot 100-GHz observations of one SFXT and one SgXB with the Northern Extended Millimetre Array. The SFXT, IGR J18410-0535, is detected as a point source at $63.4 \\pm 9.6$ $\u03bc$Jy, while the SgXB, IGR J18410-0535 remains undetected. Radio observations of IGR J18410-0535 imply a flat or inverted low-frequency spectrum, arguing for wind emission and against non-thermal flaring. Due to the uncertain SFXT distance, however, the observations do not necessarily imply a difference between the wind properties of the SFXT and SgXB. We compare the mm constraints with other HMXBs and isolated OB supergiants, before considering how future mm campaigns can constrain HMXB wind properties by including X-ray measurements. Specifically, we discuss caveats and future steps to successfully measure wind mass loss rates and velocities in HMXBs with coordinated mm, radio, and X-ray campaigns.",

    "paper_abstract": "It is expected that B5G/6G networks will exploit both terahertz (THz) and millimetre wave (mmWave) frequency bands and will increase flexibility in user equipment (UE)-cell association. In this paper, we introduce a novel stochastic geometry-based framework for the analysis of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and rate coverage in a multi-tier hybrid mmWave and THz network, where each tier has a particular base station (BS) density, transmit power, bandwidth, number of BS antennas, and cell-association bias factor. The proposed framework incorporates the effects of mmWave and THz channel characteristics, BS beamforming gain, and blockages. We investigate the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) decoupled cell-association strategy and characterise the per-tier cell-association probability. Based on that, we analytically derive the SINR and rate coverage probabilities of a typical user for both DL and UL transmissions. The analytical results are validated via extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the DL and UL decoupled cell-association strategy in terms of SINR and rate coverage over its coupled counterpart. Moreover, we observe that the superiority of using the DL and UL decoupled cell-association strategy becomes more evident with the dense deployment of THz networks.",

    "paper_abstract": "The z-GAL survey observed 137 bright Herschel-selected targets with the IRAM NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array, with the aim to measure their redshift and study their properties. Several of them have been resolved into multiple sources. Consequently, robust spectroscopic redshifts have been measured for 165 individual galaxies in the range 0.8<z<6.5. In this paper we analyse the millimetre spectra of the z-GAL sources, using both their continuum and line emission to derive their physical properties. At least two spectral lines are detected for each source, including transitions of 12CO, [CI], and H2O. The observed 12CO line ratios and spectral line energy distributions of individual sources resemble those of local starbursts. In seven sources the para-H2O(2_11-2_02) transition is detected and follows the IR versus H2O luminosity relation of sub-millimetre galaxies. The molecular gas mass of the z-GAL sources is derived from their 12CO, [CI], and sub-millimetre dust continuum emission. The three tracers lead to consistent results, with the dust continuum showing the largest scatter when compared to 12CO. The gas-to-dust mass ratio of these sources was computed by combining the information derived from 12CO and the dust continuum and has a median value of 107, similar to star-forming galaxies of near-solar metallicity. The same combined analysis leads to depletion timescales in the range between 0.1 and 1.0 Gyr, which place the z-GAL sources between the `main sequence' of star formation and the locus of starbursts. Finally, we derived a first estimate of stellar masses - modulo possible gravitational magnification - by inverting known gas scaling relations: the z-GAL sample is confirmed to be mostly composed by starbursts, whereas ~25% of its members lie on the main sequence of star-forming galaxies (within +/- 0.5 dex).",

The plane is found for a sample of 48 nearby galaxies, most of which are low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN). Combining these sources with a sample of high-luminosity (quasar-like) nearby AGN, we find that the plane still holds. We also find that $M_{\\rm BH}$ correlates with $L_{\\rm \u03bd, mm}$ at a highly significant level, although such correlation is less tight than the mm fundamental plane ($\u03c3_{\\rm int}=0.51$ dex). Crucially, we show that spectral energy distribution (SED) models for both advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) and compact jets can explain the existence of these relations, which are not reproduced by the standard torus-thin accretion disc models usually associated to quasar-like AGN. The ADAF models reproduces the observed relations somewhat better than those for compact jets, although neither provides a perfect prediction. Our findings thus suggest that radiatively-inefficient accretion processes such as those in ADAFs or compact (and thus possibly young) jets may play a key role in both low- and high-luminosity AGN. This mm fundamental plane also offers a new, rapid method to (indirectly) estimate SMBH masses.",

    "paper_abstract": "MIRI/MRS on board the JWST allows us to probe the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. Here we examine the disk around the classical T Tauri star Sz 98, which has an unusually large dust disk in the millimetre with a compact core. We focus on the H$_2$O emission through both its ro-vibrational and pure rotational emission. Furthermore, we compare our chemical findings with those obtained for the outer disk from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. In order to model the molecular features in the spectrum, the continuum was subtracted and LTE slab models were fitted. The spectrum was divided into different wavelength regions corresponding to H$_2$O lines of different excitation conditions, and the slab model fits were performed individually per region. We confidently detect CO, H$_2$O, OH, CO$_2$, and HCN in the emitting layers. The isotopologue H$^{18}_2$O is not detected. Additionally, no other organics, including C$_2$H$_2$, are detected. This indicates that the C/O ratio could be substantially below unity, in contrast with the outer disk. The H$_2$O emission traces a large radial disk surface region, as evidenced by the gradually changing excitation temperatures and emitting radii. The OH and CO$_2$ emission are relatively weak. It is likely that H$_2$O is not significantly photodissociated; either due to self-shielding against the stellar irradiation, or UV-shielding from small dust particles. The relative emitting strength of the different identified molecular features point towards UV-shielding of H$_2$O in the inner disk of Sz 98, with a thin layer of OH on top. The majority of the organic molecules are either hidden below the dust continuum, or not present. In general, the inferred composition points to a sub-solar C/O ratio (<0.5) in the inner disk, in contrast with the larger than unity C/O ratio in the gas in the outer disk found with ALMA.",

Their revolutionary discovery in a metallic alloy, less than three decades ago, has required a full reconsideration of what we defined as a crystal structure. Surprisingly, quasi-crystalline structures have been discovered also at much larger length scales in different microscopic systems for which the size of elementary building blocks ranges between the nanometric to the micrometric scale. Here, we report the first experimental observation of spontaneous quasi-crystal self-assembly at the millimetric scale. This result is obtained in a fully athermal system of macroscopic spherical grains vibrated on a substrate. Starting from a liquid-like disordered phase, the grains begin to locally arrange into three types of squared and triangular tiles that eventually align, forming 8-fold symmetric quasi-crystal that has been predicted in simulation but not yet observed experimentally in non-atomic systems. These results are not only the proof of a novel route to spontaneously assemble quasi-crystals but are of fundamental interest for the connection between equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics.",

In this work, we explore the effects of free eccentricity, and by varying disc fractional widths and observational resolutions, show for a range of narrow eccentric discs, orbital overlaps result in dust emission distributions that have either one or two radial peaks at apocentre and/or pericentre. The narrowest discs contain two radial peaks, whereas the broadest discs contain just one radial peak. For fixed eccentricities, as fractional disc widths are increased, we show that these peaks merge first at apocentre (producing apocentre glow), and then at pericentre (producing pericentre glow). Our work thus demonstrates that apocentre/pericentre glows in models with constant free and forced eccentricities can be both width and resolution dependent at millimetre wavelengths, challenging the classical assertion that apocentre/pericentre glows are purely wavelength dependent. We discuss future high-resolution observations that can distinguish between competing interpretations of underlying debris disc eccentricity distributions.",

Recent studies in the literature suggest that the bar of the Milky Way is rather old, indicating that it formed at a similar epoch to the GES merger. We investigate the possible link between these events using one of the Auriga cosmological simulations which has salient features in common with the Milky Way, including a last significant merger with kinematic signatures resembling that of the GES. In this simulation, the GES-like merger event triggers tidal forces on the disc, gas inflows and a burst of star formation, with the formation of a bar occuring within 1 Gyr of the first pericentre. To highlight the effects of the merger, we rerun the simulation from z=4 with the progenitors of the GES-like galaxy removed well before the merger time. The consequence is a delay in bar formation by around 2 Gyr, and this new bar forms without any significant external perturbers. We conclude that this Milky Way-like simulation shows a route to the real Milky Way's bar formation being triggered primarily via tidal forces from the GES. We also note some later morphological differences between the disc of the original simulation and our rerun, in particular that the latter does not grow radially for the final 7 Gyr. Our study suggests that the GES may therefore be responsible for the formation of the Milky Way's bar, as well as for the build-up of its extended disc.",

However, as ideal sites are limited, placement in remote and challenging locations results in higher logistics costs and lower average wind speeds. Therefore, it is critical to increase the reliability of the turbines to reduce maintenance costs. Robust implementation requires a thorough understanding of the loads subject to the turbine's control. Yet, such dynamically changing multidimensional loads are uncommon with other machinery, and generally underresearched. Therefore, a multitiered approach is proposed to investigate the load spectrum occurring in wind farms. Our approach relies on both fundamental research using controllable test rigs, as well as analyses of real-world loading conditions in high-frequency supervisory control and data acquisition data. A method is introduced to detect operational zones in wind farm data and link them with load distributions. Additionally, while focused research further investigates the load spectrum, a method is proposed that continuously optimizes the farm's control protocols without the need to fully understand the loads that occur. A case of gearbox failure is investigated based on a vast body of past experiments and suspect loads are identified. Starting from this evidence on the cause and effects of dynamic loads, the potential of our methods is shown by analyzing real-world farm loading conditions on a steady-state case of wake and developing a preventive row-based control protocol for a case of cascading emergency brakes induced by a storm.",
